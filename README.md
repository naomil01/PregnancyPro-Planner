# PregnancyPro-Planner 
My second project 🐍 -  I created a console app using Python called PregnancyPro Planner.  It is designed to assist couples in planning their pregnancy journey following their fertility window estimates. The Pregnancy Fertility Window API interacts with the application to retrieve fertility window data based on the user’s menstrual cycle information. 
It will then analyse this data to provide personalized recommendations for the best optimal conception timing , based on the user's menstrual cycle data.
