# PregnancyPro-Planner 
My second project -  I created a console app using Python called PregnancyPro Planner.  It is designed to assist couples in planning their pregnancy journey following their fertility window estimates. The Pregnancy Fertility Window API interacts with the application to retrieve fertility window data based on the userâ€™s menstrual cycle information.
